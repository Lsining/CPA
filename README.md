# FirstGit

The objective of this project is to make an algorythm which will capture data and give back a suggestion based on the data.
A power point presentation is availabel that gives a brief overview of the product definition.
For a platform its convinient to choose a web application since it has the ability to turn into a mobile site as well.

Divide in 2 teams,
We can use the same Trello or a different Vote: 

We can change this and since we are working in the same product just different data sets, we can share lessons learned and suggestion. Most likely One team is going to finish first than the other so whoever finishes first can help the other team. Everybody Agrees?
